✅ Extract actionable insights and recommendations

HOW TO USE:
-----------
Step 1: Open notebook
  cd ERAS8
  jupyter notebook GradCAM_Analysis.ipynb

Step 2: Run all cells
  Kernel → Restart & Run All
  Wait ~12-15 minutes

Step 3: Explore results
  - Use interactive widget in notebook
  - Browse gradcam_results/ folder
  - Open HTML files in browser

WHAT GRAD-CAM REVEALS:
-----------------------
✅ WHERE the model focuses when making predictions
✅ WHY misclassifications occur (wrong features attended)
✅ WHICH classes are most confused (leopard↔cheetah, oak↔maple)
✅ HOW confident the model is (and when it's wrong but confident)

NOTEBOOK STRUCTURE:
-------------------
Section 1 (Cells 1-3):    Setup and configuration
Section 2 (Cells 4-5):    Grad-CAM implementation
Section 3 (Cells 6-7):    Model and data loading
Section 4 (Cells 8-11):   Run predictions and collect results
Section 5 (Cells 12-17):  Overall confusion analysis
Section 6 (Cells 18-24):  Per-class deep dive (100 classes)
Section 7 (Cells 25-26):  Interactive exploration widget
Section 8 (Cells 27-35):  Insights and recommendations
Section 9 (Cell 36):      Usage summary
Section 10 (Cell 37):     Quick reference guide

KEY FEATURES:
-------------
1. WORST PREDICTION FOCUS
   - Identifies lowest confidence correct predictions
   - Prioritizes highest confidence misclassifications
   - Shows 5 worst cases per class

2. DUAL GRAD-CAM FOR ERRORS
   - True class CAM: Where should model look
   - Predicted class CAM: Where model actually looks
   - Reveals attention mismatch causing errors

3. PER-CLASS DEEP DIVE
   - 100 comprehensive class analyses
   - Best 3 + Worst 3 predictions each
   - Saved as individual PNG files

4. INTERACTIVE EXPLORATION
   - Dropdown widget for all 100 classes
   - On-demand Grad-CAM generation
   - Class-specific statistics

5. PATTERN ANALYSIS
   - Within-category confusions (animal→animal)
   - Cross-category confusions
   - High-confidence error identification

TYPICAL FINDINGS:
-----------------
• Model confuses similar classes (leopard/cheetah, oak/maple)
• Within-category confusions dominate (animals→animals)
• Some high-confidence errors (>90% but wrong!)
• Background focus causes some misclassifications
• Texture confusion (spots, stripes) is common

ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------------------
Based on Grad-CAM analysis, typical recommendations include:
1. Add label smoothing (0.1) to reduce overconfidence
2. Add color augmentation for within-category distinctions
3. Implement attention mechanisms (CBAM, SE-blocks)
4. Use contrastive learning for similar classes
5. Add targeted augmentation for worst classes
