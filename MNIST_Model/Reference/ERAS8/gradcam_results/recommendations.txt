ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MODEL IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

Based on Grad-CAM analysis of 2644 misclassifications:

1. IMPROVE FEATURE LEARNING FOR SIMILAR CLASSES
   Problem: 3 animal-to-animal confusions in top 20
   Solution:
   - Add contrastive learning for similar classes
   - Increase training samples for confused pairs via targeted augmentation
   - Use triplet loss to separate similar classes in feature space

2. ADDRESS HIGH-CONFIDENCE ERRORS
   Problem: 806 errors with >70% confidence
   Solution:
   - Add label smoothing (0.1) to reduce overconfidence
   - Implement temperature scaling for calibration
   - Use ensemble methods to improve confidence estimates

3. IMPROVE ATTENTION MECHANISMS
   Observation: Grad-CAM shows model sometimes focuses on background
   Solution:
   - Add attention modules (CBAM, SE-blocks)
   - Use object-centric augmentations (CutMix, Mixup)
   - Consider using attention-guided data augmentation

4. TARGET WORST PERFORMING CLASSES
   Classes with <50% accuracy:
   - seal: 47.0% accuracy
   - otter: 48.0% accuracy
   - girl: 48.0% accuracy
   - bowl: 49.0% accuracy
   - boy: 50.0% accuracy

   Solution:
   - Analyze if these classes need more diverse training data
   - Check if data augmentation is too aggressive for these classes
   - Consider class-specific augmentation strategies

5. LEVERAGE CONFUSION PATTERNS
   Main pattern: Within-category confusions dominate
   Solution:
   - Use hierarchical classification (category → fine-grained)
   - Add category loss as auxiliary task
   - Implement fine-grained feature learning modules

6. NEXT EXPERIMENTS
   Based on analysis:
   a) Add label smoothing (0.1) → Expected +1-2% accuracy
   b) Increase dropout to 0.1-0.15 → Reduce high-confidence errors
   c) Add color augmentation → Help with within-category distinctions
   d) Try focal loss for hard examples → Focus training on confused pairs
   e) Implement attention mechanisms → Better feature localization
