GRAD-CAM ANALYSIS SUMMARY REPORT
================================================================================

Model: CIFAR-100 ResNet-34
Model Path: ../CIFAR100HFS/cifar100_model_20251011_093931.pth
Test Dataset: CIFAR-100 (10,000 images, 100 classes)

OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
- Test Accuracy: 73.56%
- Error Rate: 26.44%
- Total Errors: 2644/10000

CONFUSION PATTERNS:
The model tends to confuse classes within the same category:
- Animal-to-Animal: 3/20 top confusions
- Vehicle-to-Vehicle: 1/20 top confusions
- Plant-to-Plant: 3/20 top confusions
- Cross-category: 13/20 top confusions

This suggests the model has learned semantic categories but struggles with
fine-grained distinctions (e.g., leopard vs tiger, oak vs maple).

HIGH CONFIDENCE ERRORS:
- Number of errors with >70% confidence: 806
- These represent cases where the model was very wrong but very confident
- Grad-CAM analysis can reveal if model focuses on misleading features

GRAD-CAM INSIGHTS:
Grad-CAM visualizations show WHERE the model looks when making predictions:
- For correct predictions: Model typically focuses on discriminative object features
- For incorrect predictions: Model often focuses on:
  * Background instead of object
  * Similar textures (spots, stripes, patterns)
  * Partial object views
  * Ambiguous regions

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Classes with <50% accuracy need more training data or better augmentation
2. Within-category confusions suggest need for fine-grained feature learning
3. High confidence errors indicate need for calibration (label smoothing)
4. Grad-CAM shows model needs better attention mechanisms for small objects
