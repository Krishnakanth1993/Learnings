# CIFAR-10 Training Experiments - Setup Phase
*This README documents the successful completion of CIFAR-10 model setup and initial training experiments. The CNN architecture with Batch Normalization and 1x1 convolution achieved consistent test accuracy above 85% with 602K+ parameters, demonstrating stable learning capabilities. The model shows significant overfitting (train-test gap > 14%), indicating the need for regularization improvements in future iterations. The systematic approach to data loading, channel-wise normalization, and model architecture provides a solid foundation for further optimization.*
