## Key Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Fast Convergence**: Model reached 99%+ accuracy by epoch 2
- **Excellent Generalization**: Only 0.47% gap between train and test accuracy

### Surprising Results
- **No Overfitting**: Despite 6.38M parameters and no regularization, model generalizes well

- **High Accuracy**: 99.52% test accuracy with simplified architecture

### Lessons Learned
- MNIST is simple enough that complex regularization may not be necessary
- Direct conv-to-class mapping can be very effective
- Large parameter count doesn't always lead to overfitting on simple datasets
