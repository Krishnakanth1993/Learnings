## Key Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Fast Convergence**: Models reached 99%+ accuracy by epoch 2-3
- **Excellent Generalization**: 0.42-0.46% gap between train and test accuracy
- **High Reproducibility**: Consistent results across different runs
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of model.py works perfectly
- **Parameter Reduction**: 94% reduction (6.38M → 388K) with minimal accuracy loss

### Surprising Results
- **No Overfitting**: Despite large parameter counts, models generalize well
- **Fast Training**: 5-14 minutes for 15-20 epochs on CUDA
- **High Accuracy**: 99.39-99.52% test accuracy across all architectures
- **Low Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: 10x learning rate change had minimal impact
- **FC Layer Dominance**: 80.7% of parameters in fully connected layers

### Critical Findings
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Conv layers are highly efficient (19.3% of params)
- **FC Bottleneck**: Fully connected layers consume 80.7% of parameters
- **Capacity Limitation**: Post-epoch 10 plateau suggests need for more capacity
- **Architecture Impact**: Cake architecture provides better structure and efficiency

### Lessons Learned
- MNIST is simple enough that complex regularization may not be necessary
- Direct conv-to-class mapping can be very effective
- Large parameter count doesn't always lead to overfitting on simple datasets
- Model architecture is stable and reproducible across different hyperparameters
- Modular code structure (model.py separation) improves maintainability
- **FC layers are the main parameter bottleneck** - need GAP + 1x1 convs for 8K target
- **Cake architecture provides excellent foundation** for parameter reduction

### Next Major Steps
1. **Replace FC layers with GAP + 1x1 convolutions** to achieve 8K parameter target
2. **Add more conv layers to final blocks** to address capacity limitations
3. **Implement proper BatchNorm throughout** for better training stability
4. **Add dropout for regularization** to prevent end-of-training degradation
