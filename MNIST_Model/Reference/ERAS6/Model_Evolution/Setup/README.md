## Key Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Fast Convergence**: Model reached 99%+ accuracy by epoch 2
- **Excellent Generalization**: Only 0.42-0.43% gap between train and test accuracy
- **High Reproducibility**: 99.51% vs 99.52% test accuracy across runs
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of model.py works perfectly

### Surprising Results
- **No Overfitting**: Despite 6.38M parameters and no regularization, model generalizes well
- **Fast Training**: 9-14 minutes for 15-20 epochs on CUDA
- **High Accuracy**: 99.51-99.52% test accuracy with simplified architecture
- **Low Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: 10x learning rate change had minimal impact

### Lessons Learned
- MNIST is simple enough that complex regularization may not be necessary
- Direct conv-to-class mapping can be very effective
- Large parameter count doesn't always lead to overfitting on simple datasets
- Model architecture is stable and reproducible across different hyperparameters
- Modular code structure (model.py separation) improves maintainability
