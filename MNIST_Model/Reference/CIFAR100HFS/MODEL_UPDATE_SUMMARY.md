# Model Update Summary - FT-3 Best Model

## Issue
The app.py couldn't load the best model checkpoint (`cifar100_model_20251011_093931.pth`) from FT-3 experiment due to configuration mismatches.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Dropout Mismatch**: 
   - `app.py` was configured with `dropout_rate=0.05`
   - FT-3 model was trained with `dropout_rate=0.0`
   
2. **Unpickling Issue**:
   - Checkpoint contains `TrainingConfig` class from `cifar100_training` module
   - Module not available in deployment environment

3. **PyTorch 2.6+ Security**:
   - `torch.load()` requires `weights_only=False` for pickled objects

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `app.py` - Line 60
**Before:**
```python
dropout_rate=0.05
```

**After:**
```python
dropout_rate=0.0  # Model was trained with no dropout
```

### 2. Added TrainingConfig Unpickling Support
**Added to `app.py` (lines 25-62):**
- Dummy `TrainingConfig` dataclass matching training configuration
- Registered as `cifar100_training` module in `sys.modules`
- Added to `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals()` for PyTorch 2.6+

### 3. Updated torch.load() Call
**Changed in `load_model()` function:**
```python
checkpoint = torch.load(model_path, map_location=device, weights_only=False)
```

### 4. Added Error Traceback
**For better debugging:**
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Error loading model: {str(e)}")
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()
    return False
```

## Model Architecture Verification

The checkpoint analysis confirms:
- **Architecture**: ResNet-34 with BasicBlock
- **Blocks per layer**: [3, 4, 6, 3] (standard ResNet-34)
- **Parameters**: 21,328,292 (~21.3M)
- **Final layer**: FC(512 → 100)
- **Dropout**: 0.0 (no dropout layers active)

The `model.py` already had the correct ResNet-34 implementation matching the checkpoint!

## Testing

To test the updated app locally:
```bash
cd CIFAR100HFS
python app.py
```

Or use the model directly:
```bash
cp C:\Users\krish\Documents\Krishnakanth\Learnings\Learnings\MNIST_Model\Reference\CIFAR100HFS\cifar100_model_20251011_093931.pth CIFAR100HFS/cifar100_model.pth
```

## FT-3 Model Performance

This is the **best model** from all experiments:
- **Test Accuracy**: 73.57%
- **Train Accuracy**: 84.35%
- **Train-Test Gap**: 10.78% (best generalization)
- **Optimizer**: Adam with OneCycleLR
- **Training**: 30 epochs, 36 minutes
- **Overfitting**: 0 epochs

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Fix dropout_rate configuration
- [x] Add TrainingConfig unpickling support
- [x] Update torch.load() for PyTorch 2.6+
- [x] Add error tracebacks for debugging
- [ ] Copy model checkpoint to CIFAR100HFS/cifar100_model.pth
- [ ] Test locally before deploying
- [ ] Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces
- [ ] Update README with FT-3 model info

## Files Modified

1. `CIFAR100HFS/app.py`
   - Line 60: Changed dropout_rate from 0.05 to 0.0
   - Lines 18-62: Added imports and TrainingConfig support
   - Line 111: Added weights_only=False to torch.load()
   - Lines 129-132: Added error traceback

2. `CIFAR100HFS/model.py`
   - No changes needed! Already correct ResNet-34 implementation

## Next Steps

1. Copy the FT-3 model to deployment directory:
   ```bash
   copy "C:\Users\krish\Documents\Krishnakanth\Learnings\Learnings\MNIST_Model\Reference\CIFAR100HFS\cifar100_model_20251011_093931.pth" "CIFAR100HFS\cifar100_model.pth"
   ```

2. Test locally:
   ```bash
   cd CIFAR100HFS
   python app.py
   ```

3. If successful, deploy to Hugging Face Spaces

4. Update Space README with FT-3 model details:
   - 73.57% test accuracy
   - ResNet-34 architecture
   - 21.3M parameters
   - Trained with Adam + OneCycleLR

---

**Status**: ✅ Model alignment complete. Ready for local testing and deployment.
